# Tic-Tac-Toe AI
The classic Tic Tac Toe game, with three different AI levels. Play with CPU or watch them fight for your own pleasure!
 
## This project makes use of the following algorithms:
* minmax (with Recursion)

## Application Features
* Usage: run tictactoe.py and input command "start [user/easy/medium/hard] [user/easy/medium/hard]".
* Easy difficulty just makes CPU pick a random empty cell to place its mark.
* Medium difficulty forces the CPU to make a winning move, or block a player's winning move if able.
* Hard difficulty is impossible to win, thanks to the Minmax algorithm that calculates all possible outcomes for each move and acts accordingly.
* To watch two bots fight it out, simply write "start hard hard" or "start hard medium" or any combination you want!
